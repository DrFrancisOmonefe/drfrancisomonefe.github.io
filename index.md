## Installation
To get started with the Salary REST Service, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DrFrancisOmonefe/salary-rest-service.git
   cd salary-rest-service
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   If you are using Poetry, run:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Use the following command to start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Docker Deployment** (Optional):
   To run the application in a Docker container, use:
   ```bash
   docker build -t salary-rest-service .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 salary-rest-service
   ```

## Usage
After starting the application, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000`. You can also visit the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Authentication
To access protected routes, you need to obtain a JWT token. Use the `/token` endpoint to log in with your credentials. You will receive a token that you can use in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

### Example Request
Here‚Äôs how to make a request to the API:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/salaries" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token"
```

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- **POST /token**: Obtain a JWT token.
  - **Request Body**: 
    ```json
    {
      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password"
    }
    ```

### Salary Data
- **GET /salaries**: Retrieve a list of salaries.
- **GET /salaries/{id}**: Retrieve a specific salary by ID.
- **POST /salaries**: Create a new salary entry.
- **PUT /salaries/{id}**: Update an existing salary entry.
- **DELETE /salaries/{id}**: Delete a salary entry.

## Testing
To ensure the application works as expected, run the tests using Pytest. Use the following command:
```bash
pytest
```

You can also run tests in a Docker container if you prefer.
